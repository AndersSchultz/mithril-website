# Starting point for a lean and fast web application
## Utilizing well-known, small and efficient libraries and "mini" frameworks
## Learn how it is built by going through the tutorials

By utilizing a horde of clever minds and putting their work together, I am in this space building a starting point for a web application that uses these principles:

- Dependency exclusively on small libraries and frameworks that are in the top of their fields
- Each small library can be replaced by another one  that in time proves more efficient
- No dependency on a big, monolithic framework in which to place your destiny

Focus points / features:
- Optimized for speed
- Single page JavaScript web application
- Fully SEO "compatible" by utilizing server side rendered content
- Optimized for speed by utilizing static pages (though website in general )
- Hot reloading during development
- Immutability () 

Technologies in the stack:

- JavaScript / HTML / CSS
- Node.js
- Webpack
- Mithril.js - (incredibly fast) rendering engine
Still to come:
- Redux - (clear and plain) state management
- RethinkDB - (awesome, no-schema database with) 

The tutorials are published here on Github. First one is available now (still being polished)

Please, contact me if something is not understandable or if you have ideas to improve the project. I will gladly help you out and listen to your feedback to improve my work here.
