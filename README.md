# Starting point for a lean and fast web application
## Utilizing well-known, small and efficient libraries and "mini" frameworks
## Learn how it is built by going through the tutorials

By utilizing a horde of clever minds and putting their work together, I am in this space building a starting point for a web application that uses these principles:

- Dependency exclusively on small libraries and frameworks that are in the top of their fields
- Each small library can be replaced by another one  that in time proves more efficient
- No dependency on a big, monolithic framework in which to place your destiny

Focus points / features:
- Single page JavaScript web application
- Fully SEO "compatible" by utilizing server side rendered content
- Optimized for speed by utilizing static pages (though website in general )
- Hot reloading during development
- Immutability
- Still adding to the list ...

Technologies in the stack:

- JavaScript / HTML / CSS
- Mithril.js - (incredibly fast) rendering engine
- Node.js
- Webpack
- GIT
Still to come:
- Redux - (clear and plain) state management
- RethinkDB - (awesome, no-schema database with) 

The tutorials are published here on Github. First one is available (still being polished)

1) [Getting our basic mithril.js app up and running](http://tutorials.visionaryprogrammer.com/mithril-js-basic-application/)

The branch that goes with furst tutorial is: tutorial01
